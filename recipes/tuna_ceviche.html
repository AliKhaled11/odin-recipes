    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description">
      Fresh chunks of tuna, ripe mango, and creamy avocado combine to make the
      perfect appetizer or a tasty lunch. I love to eat this with lime-seasoned
      tortilla chips, but it's just as delicious served in lettuce cups. I try
      to keep the tuna, avocado and mango pieces between 1/4- and 1/2-inch in
      size. Best eaten same-day, but can be kept 1-2 days in fridge, keeping in
      mind that texture will change.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>1 pound sushi-grade tuna, diced</li>
      <li>½ cup diced avocado</li>

      <li>¼ cup minced red onion</li>
      <li>¼ cup minced cilantro</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced jalapeno pepper</li>
      <li>⅓ cup fresh lime juice</li>

    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        Combine tuna, avocado, mango, red onion, cilantro, and jalapeno in a
